# House Price Prediction

This project applies Linear Regression to predict house prices using the Housing dataset. Data was inspected, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets. The model was evaluated using MAE and RMSE. A predicted vs actual plot visualizes performance. Coefficients were analyzed to understand which features most influence house prices.
